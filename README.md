# Phishing Email Analysis Challenge

## üõ† Challenge Objective
Analyze a suspicious email to determine if it is a phishing attempt using tools like Microsoft Outlook, VirusTotal, and Cisco Talos Intelligence.

---

## üìÇ Scenario
An email claiming to be from PayPal in German was provided as a password-protected `.zip` file. The task was to investigate the email, focusing on headers, domain reputation, and embedded URLs.

---

## üîç Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Unzip the File
- The challenge provided a password-protected `.zip` file.
- Used the password `infected` to extract the contents, which included an `.eml` file (email format).

### Step 2: Open the Email File
- Used **Microsoft Outlook** to analyze the extracted `.eml` file.
- Translated the German email to English using Microsoft Translate.

### Step 3: Investigate the Return Path
- Accessed email headers via Outlook properties.
- Identified a suspicious return path: `{bounce@rjttznyzjjzydnillquh.designclub.uk.com}`.

### Step 4: Analyze the Email Content
- The email contained a button labeled **"Setzen Sie die Lieferung fort"** (translated: "Continue Delivery").
- Hovered over the button to reveal the URL: `storage.googleapis.com`.
  - Observed that the domain is legitimate, but the URL path included randomized strings, raising suspicion.

### Step 5: Scan the URL in VirusTotal
- Entered the suspicious URL into **VirusTotal**.
- Observations:
  - The URL was flagged as suspicious by multiple detection engines.
  - Opened the **Details** tab in VirusTotal to retrieve the **SHA-256 hash** for documentation.

### Step 6: Check Domain Reputation
- Verified the domain reputation using **Cisco Talos Intelligence** and **VirusTotal**.
- Confirmed that the subdomain was involved in phishing activity.

### Step 7: Retrieve SHA-256 Hash
- From the VirusTotal **Details** tab, obtained the SHA-256 hash of the suspicious URL:  
  `{13945ecc33afee74ac7f72e1d5bb73050894356c4bf63d02a1a53e76830567f5}`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Conclusion
The email was confirmed to be a phishing attempt based on:
1. A suspicious return path unrelated to PayPal.
2. A legitimate domain (`storage.googleapis.com`) exploited via DNS shadowing.
3. VirusTotal flagged the URL as suspicious, supported by its SHA-256 hash.
4. Community reviews and detection engines identified phishing activity.
